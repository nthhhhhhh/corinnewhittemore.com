    """Corinne grew up in the Rio Grande Valley and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a major in Graphic Design from the University of Texas-Pan American. Continuing her education, she received her MFA in Visual Communications from the University of Arizona. While in graduate school, she taught Art 265, a beginning level graphic design course, and has been teaching at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley for the past three years. In her teaching, she strives to instill the responsibility of the designer within society as well as provide her students with the skills and knowledge needed to understand and produce good design.

Corinne has worked in the field of graphic design for about fifteen years as a Production Artist, Graphic Designer, Marketing Coordinator and Freelancer on both the East and West Coasts. She lived, most recently, in Virginia Beach, VA before moving back to the Valley in 2014. Corinne continues to design and consult offering her services through her design company, ecmw design.

Her current research is the study of border culture and includes photographing flea markets, religious icons, popular culture, and street and storefront signage of the Rio Grande Valley. Her artwork is digital photomontage and mirrors her research using photographs she has taken over a period of ten years of the border area. Corinne describes her art as being, ...as much a personal documentation and exploration of how I resonate with my culture as well as my struggle to find place and connection within my own culture and heritage. It is a visual account of the thriving culture unique to border areas of the United States. Corinne is currently working on a collaborative book project entitled, Borderland Mujeres."""
